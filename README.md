# Time Series Analysis on Bitcoin Cryptocurrency

This analysis is part of the master thesis I've done during my studies. Here you can find a brief introduction of the aims and the object of analysis. Then, you can find the code I've used to make these calculation. 
This is only the first version, I would re-write and adjust the code to make it accessible for everyone. Moreover, I would try to be as much clear as possible. Feel free to fork, adapt and use the code but please, if you find it interesting, give merit to the work I've done. Thanks!
